### Hi, I'm Mari!

Mobile Developer specialized in React Native, currently working at Paraná Banco, where I began my development journey as an intern. I made a career transition from the product area, where I worked as a Product Owner, in 2021. I stand out for my clear communication, proactivity, and fast learning
